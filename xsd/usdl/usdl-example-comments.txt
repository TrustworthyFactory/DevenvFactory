Notes on the creation of USDL descriptions

- How to create a conceptual link between a business service and its producer/provider:
-- Association usdl:Service -> usdl:BusinessEntity through usdl:hasInvolvedEntity. usdl-br contains a list of valid business roles. 
--- Example
usdl:hasInvolvedEntity [
	a usdl:InvolvedEntity ;

	usdl:hasBusinessEntity <http://www.acme.ie/offerings/offering-id-231#ES6IqLmZvHhXNwBbs> ;
	usdl:hasBusinessRole usdl-br:provider ;

	] .

- How to structure USDL Service Descriptions (MANDATORY): each service must have two descriptions, abstract and long description. They must be in plain text.
-- short descriptions: dcterms:abstract in usdl:Service element
-- long descriptions: dcterms:description in usdl:Service element
																											
- How to express Service Localisation (MANDATORY):
-- usdl:Service needs to have the information of the localization it supports. This can be done through dcterms:language .

- How to describe a usdl:Service  in terms of a list of fixed Lines of Business (MANDATORY)
A small taxonomy has been created as list of SKOS concepts. It is defined in the marketplace-vocabulary file. A usdl:Service can be described by usdl:hasClassification, like in the following example:
-- usdl:hasClassification optet-mkp:HumanResources .

- How to keep track of USDL description versions
-- usdl:ServiceDescription is necessary to keep track of date of creation, modification, author(s) and service description version (dcterms:hasVersion).

- How to express a price for an offering
-- USDL provides a rather detailed model for expressing a pricing policy for a service. The marketplace uses a PriceComponent to describe a price

<owl:NamedIndividual rdf:about="http://www.acme.ie/offerings/offering-id-231#Kz9z3IUgEQArMfRz8">
        <rdf:type rdf:resource="&price;PriceComponent"/>
        <gr:hasCurrencyValue rdf:datatype="&xsd;float">100000.0</gr:hasCurrencyValue>
        <dcterms:description xml:lang="en"></dcterms:description>
        <gr:hasCurrency>EUR</gr:hasCurrency>
        <gr:hasUnitOfMeasurement></gr:hasUnitOfMeasurement>
        <dcterms:title xml:lang="en">Standard Price</dcterms:title>
    </owl:NamedIndividual>

The PriceComponent is then used by a PricePlan that can specify a few details of a pricing policy:
	
<http://www.acme.ie/offerings/offering-id-231#Lo2ZSYmeXu15euf4Y> rdf:type price:PricePlan ,
			 owl:NamedIndividual ;
	
	dcterms:description ""@en ;
	
	dcterms:title "Standard Price Plan"@en ;
	
	price:hasPriceComponent <http://www.acme.ie/offerings/offering-id-231#Kz9z3IUgEQArMfRz8> .

Then, one (or more) PricePlan can be used to describe a pricing policy, in the form of a Service Offering linked to a usdl:Service:

<http://www.acme.ie/offerings/offering-id-231#SQstQpBtZhbcYJEcW> rdf:type usdl:ServiceOffering ,
			 owl:NamedIndividual ;
	
	usdl:validFrom "2011-12-01"^^xsd:datetime ;
	
	usdl:validThrough "2011-12-31"^^xsd:datetime ;
	
	dcterms:description ""@en ;
	
	dcterms:title "Service Offering Description"@en ;
	
	usdl:includes <http://www.acme.ie/offerings/offering-id-231#bYJNRUE4AQvTRuYgu> ;
	
	usdl:hasPricePlan <http://www.acme.ie/offerings/offering-id-231#Lo2ZSYmeXu15euf4Y> .

-- one can use foaf:page .
